           <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-h-049445127/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="name">Daniel Hernández</a> is a Venezuelan self-taught app developer with a passion for beautiful, simple web apps. Why complicate things more than they should be?
        </p>
        <p>
          He started programming when he was 14, and has been at it ever since. Check out his <a href="https://github.com/DHDaniel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub Profile</a> or his agency website, <a href="https://sunnysidecode.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sunnyside Software</a>, to learn more about what makes him tick.
        </p>
        <p>
          He arrived in San Francisco in August 2018 to study Computational Sciences and Business at the <a href="https://www.minerva.kgi.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Minerva Schools at KGI</a>. And he is quite excited to attend his first ever hackathon, JAMStack, which is coincidentially hosted by the very <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">same website</a> that he used to learn Node.js a couple years back!
        </p>
        <p>
          And yes, he also thinks it's kind of weird to talk in the third person.
